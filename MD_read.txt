## Mutation and predictions 

Mutations and predictions were made using 'src/studentmachine/predict.py'

#### Input Requirements:
The input require a CSV file containing binder name, sequence and ipAE score for different targets

Defining the input CSV file: 
    ```
    df = pd.read_csv('data/NLFR_master_dataset_1000.csv')
    ```

Define the protein representation type:
    ```
    x_type = 'esm2'
    ```
- It could also be 'blosum62' or 'ohe'

Creating a library
    ```
    lib = pai.Library(source='data/NLFR_master_dataset_1000.csv', names_col='name', seqs_col='binder_seq', y_col=y_col, y_type='num')
    ```
- Define the column containing the name and sequence
